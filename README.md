# Braccio Chess Robot Arm

Welcome to my **Braccio Chess Robot Arm** project! This repository houses my personal exploration into building a chess-playing robot arm using the Braccio platform.

## Overview

The **Braccio Chess Robot Arm** is a fun and experimental project where I'm combining various technologies to create a chess-playing robot. The main components of this project are:

- **Braccio Robotic Arm:** I'm utilising the Braccio robotic arm for the physical manipulation of chess pieces on the board.

- **Computer Vision:** I'm experimenting with computer vision techniques to enable the robot arm to "see" the chessboard and recognise the positions of the pieces.

- **ROS Integration:** I've integrated the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control the robot arm and facilitate communication between different components.

- **Inverse Kinematics:** For movement of the robotic arm i will attempt to write a inverse kinematics solver.

## Goals

This project is primarily for my personal exploration and enjoyment and to practise my skills with computer vision and writing inverse kinmatic solvers!
