# Braccio pick and place Robot Arm

Welcome to my **Braccio Robot Arm** project! This repository houses my exploration into building a pick-and-place robot arm using the Braccio platform.

## Overview

The **BraccioRobot Arm** is a fun and experimental project where I'm combining various technologies to create a chess-playing robot. The main components of this project are:

- **Braccio Robotic Arm:** I'm utilising the Braccio robotic arm to physically manipulate objects on the board.

- **Computer Vision:** I'm experimenting with computer vision techniques to enable the robot arm to "see" the chessboard and recognise the positions of the pieces.

- **ROS Integration:** I've integrated the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control the robot arm and facilitate communication between different components.

- **Inverse Kinematics:** For the movement of the robotic arm I will attempt to write an inverse kinematics solver.

## Goals

This project is primarily for my personal exploration and enjoyment and to practise my skills with computer vision and writing inverse kinematic solvers!
